# Contributing to mb-project-01_ci-cd-in-azure

We welcome contributions from the community and are pleased to have you join us. This document will guide you through the contribution process.

## Code of Conduct

By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [your-email@domain.com].

## Issues

Issues are a great way to point out bugs, propose new features, or discuss changes before implementing them. We encourage you to report issues or make suggestions. Please check to make sure an issue doesn’t already exist before creating a new one.

### Using the Issue Tracker

Use the issue tracker to follow the discussion instead of sending an email. We'll be able to keep better track of what’s going on and close issues once they’re resolved.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are always welcome. When you edit the code, please adhere to the existing coding style. You can simplify code review and approval by following these guidelines:

1. **Create a branch**: Fork the repo and then create a branch from where you want to base your work (usually from the main development branch).
2. **Add commits**: Write clear, logical, commit messages.
3. **Open a pull request**: Consider starting the pull request early so that others can review your work or give you feedback. Provide a concise description of the changes proposed.
4. **Discuss and review**: You will likely receive feedback or requests for changes to your pull request. This is a big part of the submission process, so be open to discussing potential improvements.

### Pull Request Checklist

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Pull requests must pass all automated tests and checks.
- Documentation must be updated if necessary.

## License

By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the terms of the MIT License.
